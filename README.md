# AI-Based Twitter/X Mining for Public Discourse Analysis | Web Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains Python pipelines and research notebooks for collecting, preprocessing, and analysing large-scale Twitter/X data to study news distribution, algorithmic amplification, and public discourse dynamics.

The project investigates how social media platforms shape information exposure, engagement signals, and sentiment polarisation — aligning with research in AI-driven analysis of news media and computational social science.

---

## 🎯 Research Objectives

This work supports research on:

- AI-mediated news distribution
- Algorithmic amplification and engagement bias
- Sentiment and discourse polarization
- Representativeness of public opinion signals
- Detection of informational asymmetries

The pipeline is designed to extract scalable engagement signals from thousands to millions of social media posts, suitable for modelling news feed behaviour and content moderation analysis.
